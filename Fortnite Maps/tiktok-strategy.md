## Pre-Launch Hype Strategy

### Week -3 to -2: Tease the Concept
- Post concept art, mood boards, early screenshots
- "Would you play this?" engagement posts
- Don't reveal the map name yet — build mystery

### Week -2 to -1: Build Anticipation
- Reveal the name: DEAD PROFIT
- Show gameplay snippets — jumpscare moments, day/night transitions
- "Coming [date]" countdown posts
- Start a "Dev Log" mini-series (3-4 episodes)

### Week -1: Final Push
- Release a 15-second teaser trailer
- "Drop a 💀 if you want the code on Day 1" — engagement + saves for notification
- Go live on TikTok doing a final build session
- Countdown: "3 days..." "2 days..." "Tomorrow."

### Launch Day:
- Post trailer at 6 PM EST
- Pin comment with map code
- Go live playing it
- Respond to EVERY comment for the first 2 hours (algorithm loves early engagement)

## Clip Editing Tips

### Software
- **CapCut** (free, TikTok-integrated, perfect for this)
- **DaVinci Resolve** for anything more complex

### Style Guide
- **Fast cuts** — no clip longer than 3 seconds unless it's a build-up to a scare
- **Subtitles on everything** — 80% of TikTok is watched muted. Use CapCut auto-captions, then style them (bold, colored keywords)
- **Sound design matters more than music** — for horror clips, use ambient dread + sudden loud sounds. For tycoon/building clips, use trending audio
- **The 1-second rule:** If the first second doesn't hook, they're gone. Start mid-action or with a bold text overlay

### Formats That Work
- **Before/After:** Empty lot → finished park (satisfying)
- **POV:** First-person gameplay with text narration
- **Storytime + Gameplay:** Talk over clips ("So I built this horror map...")
- **Reaction Duets:** React to your own scares or others playing
- **Tutorial:** Quick tips, always start with "Here's something most people don't know..."

### Technical
- Record at 1080p minimum, 60fps preferred
- Use Fortnite's replay mode for cinematic shots
- Vertical crop (9:16) — frame the action in center
- Brightness UP for horror clips (TikTok compression darkens everything)
