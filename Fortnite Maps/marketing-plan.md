# Marketing Plan — Beyond TikTok

---

## YouTube Strategy

### Channel Setup
- Same branding as TikTok (Loopgate, same pfp, banner with map screenshots)
- Channel description emphasizes "Fortnite Creative map builder" for search

### Content Pillars (Weekly Cadence)

| Day | Content Type | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| **Tuesday** | Dev Log (8-15 min) | "Building DEAD PROFIT — Dev Log #3: The Entity AI" |
| **Friday** | Gameplay / Showcase (5-10 min) | "DEAD PROFIT Full Playthrough — All 5 Nights" |
| **Saturday** | Shorts (repurpose TikTok) | Best clips reposted as Shorts |

### YouTube-Specific Tactics
- **SEO titles:** "Best Fortnite Horror Map 2026" / "Fortnite Tycoon Horror Map Code"
- **Thumbnails:** High contrast, expressive face (if on camera) or in-game screenshot with bold text. Entity close-up + scared player.
- **Descriptions:** First 2 lines = map code + what it is. Include timestamps. Tag relevant keywords.
- **Playlists:** "DEAD PROFIT Dev Logs" / "Map Showcases" / "Fortnite Creative Tutorials"
- **Shorts are your growth engine** — repurpose every TikTok as a Short. Different title/description for YouTube SEO.
- **End screens:** Always point to "watch next" and subscribe

### Milestone Goals
- Month 1: 10 videos, 100 subs (realistic starting point)
- Month 3: 30 videos, 500-1K subs
- Month 6: 2-5K subs if map gains traction

## Reddit Strategy

### Target Subreddits

| Subreddit | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| r/FortniteCreative (180K+) | Primary. Share map codes, dev logs, screenshots. Follow self-promo rules (usually 1:10 ratio) |
| r/FortNiteBR (2M+) | Occasional cross-post when something is genuinely impressive |
| r/UEFN | Technical posts about how you built mechanics |
| r/gaming | Only for truly viral-worthy clips |
| r/IndieGaming | Dev log crosspost |
| r/gamedesign | GDD discussion, "how I designed a horror tycoon hybrid" |

### Reddit Rules of Engagement
- **Don't just drop links.** Provide value — write a genuine post, include screenshots inline, tell the story
- **Comment on other posts** for 1-2 weeks before posting your own content
- **Best post format:** "I spent X weeks building [concept]. Here's what I learned." + screenshots + map code at the end
- **Respond to every comment** — Reddit rewards engagement in the first hour

### Reddit Post Templates

**Launch Post:**
```
Title: I built a co-op horror tycoon in Fortnite Creative — DEAD PROFIT [Map Code: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX]

Hey r/FortniteCreative! I've been working on this for the past few months
and it's finally live.

DEAD PROFIT is a 1-4 player co-op where you rebuild a haunted amusement park
by day and survive entity attacks by night. The twist: the more successful
your park gets, the stronger the horror becomes.

[Screenshots / GIFs]

Features:
- 5-night cycle with escalating difficulty
- 6+ buildable attractions
- 5 unique entity types (the Mimics will get you)
- Co-op roles emerge naturally
- ~30 min per full run

Would love feedback from this community. What works? What's broken?
Drop a comment and I'll respond to everyone.

Map Code: XXXX-XXXX-XXXX

## Influencer Outreach

### Target: Small Fortnite Creative Streamers/YouTubers (1K-50K followers)
Why small? They actually respond, they need content, and their audiences are highly engaged.

### Where to Find Them
- Search "Fortnite Creative" on TikTok → sort by recent → find creators with 5K-50K followers
- YouTube search "Fortnite map codes" → channels with 1K-20K subs
- Twitch "Fortnite Creative" category → streamers with 10-200 viewers

### DM Script — TikTok/Twitter

```
Hey [Name]! Love your [specific video/content they made — be genuine].

I just built a co-op horror tycoon map in Fortnite Creative called
DEAD PROFIT — players rebuild a haunted amusement park by day and
survive entity attacks at night.

Would love to see you play it with your squad. I think your audience
would lose it at the Mimic jumpscares lol.

Map code: [CODE]

No pressure at all — just thought it'd make great content for your
channel. Happy to hop in a game with you too if you want!
```

### DM Script — YouTube/Longer Form

```
Hey [Name],

Been watching your Fortnite Creative content for a while — [specific
compliment about their style].

I'm a UEFN creator and just released DEAD PROFIT, a 1-4 player co-op
horror tycoon. Players rebuild a haunted amusement park by day and
fight off entities at night. The catch: the more successful your park,
the harder the nights get.

I think this could make a really fun video for your channel — the co-op
chaos and jumpscare moments are super clip-worthy.

Trailer: [YouTube link]

Would love to send you any info or jump in a game together. Either way,
keep making great stuff!

### Follow-Up Rules
- **Wait 5-7 days** before following up once
- If no response to follow-up, move on — never triple-message
- If they play it, **thank them publicly** (quote tweet, duet, comment)
- Track outreach in a spreadsheet: Name, Platform, Followers, Date Sent, Response

- **Summer:** "Haunted Water Park update" — seasonal content

### 4. Community Challenges

Subject: Fortnite Creative Map Combines Horror + Tycoon in Co-op — DEAD PROFIT
