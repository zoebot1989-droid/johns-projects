# Map Concept: DEAD PROFIT

## A Co-op Horror Tycoon Hybrid for Fortnite Creative / UEFN

---

## High Concept

**DEAD PROFIT** — 1-4 players run an abandoned amusement park that's infested with entities. By day, you rebuild rides and attractions to earn visitors (currency). By night, the entities come out and you must survive, defend your park, and push them back. The more successful your park becomes, the more powerful the entities get.

**Tagline:** *"The park wants your money. The Entity wants your soul."*

**Genre Mashup:** Tycoon (build/earn loop) × Survival Horror (nighttime PvE) × Co-op × Roguelite progression

---

## Story & Setting

**Lore:** You're a crew of broke entrepreneurs who bought "Malmouth Funland" at auction for $1. Seemed like a steal. The park closed in 1987 after "The Incident" — rides malfunctioned, people disappeared, the owner vanished. Now you're here to reopen it. But every night after the visitors leave, the park comes alive in the worst way.

**The Entity** is tied to the park's original owner, who made a deal to keep the park running forever. The more visitors you attract, the stronger the Entity's hold becomes. You're feeding it. But you need the money. That's the tension.

**Tone:** Campy horror meets capitalist satire. Think Five Nights at Freddy's meets RollerCoaster Tycoon meets Lethal Company. Scary but funny. Dark but colorful.

## Gameplay Loop

### Phase 1: DAY (3 minutes)
- Visitors stream into your park automatically
- You earn **Tickets** (currency) based on active attractions
- Spend Tickets to:
  - Build new rides/attractions (Ferris wheel, haunted house, roller coaster, etc.)
  - Repair damaged structures from last night
  - Buy weapons/traps for nighttime defense
  - Upgrade existing attractions (more visitors = more income)
- Explore the park for hidden lore items and blueprints
- **Co-op:** Players split roles — one builds, one repairs, one scouts, one shops

### Phase 2: DUSK (30 seconds)
- Warning sirens. Visitors flee. Lights flicker.
- Players scramble to set up defenses and grab weapons
- Tension-building audio/visual shift (screen desaturates, fog rolls in)

### Phase 3: NIGHT (2 minutes)
- Entities spawn from corrupted zones in the park
- **Entity types:**
  - **Wanderers** — Slow, patrol paths, destroy attractions they touch
  - **Mimics** — Disguise as park objects (benches, trash cans) until you're close
  - **The Conductor** — Possesses rides, turning them into deathtraps
  - **Hollow Kids** — Fast, appear in groups, terrifying audio
  - **The Owner** (Boss, Night 5+) — Teleports, corrupts areas, must be driven back not killed
- Players fight with limited ammo/tools: flashlight (stuns), nail gun, fire extinguisher (freezes), flare launcher
- Entities damage/destroy attractions — anything destroyed loses income next day
- **Survive until dawn**

### Phase 4: DAWN (15 seconds)
- Score screen: income earned, damage taken, entities eliminated
- Bonus Tickets for performance
- Loop resets to Day

**Match Length:** 5 Nights = ~30 minutes per full run. Perfect session length.

## Progression System

### Within a Run (5 Nights)
| Night | Day Income Multiplier | Entity Difficulty | New Mechanic Unlocked |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | 1x | Easy — Wanderers only | Tutorial prompts |
| 2 | 1.5x | + Mimics appear | Trap crafting unlocked |
| 3 | 2x | + Conductor appears | Ride upgrades available |
| 4 | 3x | + Hollow Kids | Secret area accessible |
| 5 | 5x | THE OWNER arrives | Final stand mechanic |

### Park Rating (Persistent-ish)
- **1 Star** — Empty lot with one booth
- **2 Stars** — A few rides, still sketchy
- **3 Stars** — Legitimate park, visitors line up
- **4 Stars** — Premium attractions, Entity is furious
- **5 Stars** — Fully restored Malmouth Funland (near-impossible, bragging rights)

### Ticket Spending Priorities (Player Choice = Replayability)
- **Offense Build:** More weapons, traps, turrets → easier nights, less income
- **Economy Build:** More rides, upgrades → harder nights, more income
- **Balanced:** The intended path but players will min-max

## What Makes It Unique

1. **No one has done horror + tycoon in Fortnite Creative.** Tycoons exist. Horror exists. This is the first fusion.
2. **The core tension is brilliant:** Building your park MAKES the horror worse. Success is its own punishment. Players constantly debate "should we build more or save for weapons?"
3. **Co-op is the core, not an afterthought.** Roles emerge naturally. The builder, the fighter, the scout, the hoarder. Every friend group will have their dynamic.
4. **Designed for content creation:** Jump scares, funny moments, arguments about spending, clutch saves, wipes. Every run generates clips.
5. **Replayable:** Different build strategies, randomized entity spawns, hidden lore to find, star rating to chase.
6. **Accessible horror:** Not so scary that young players can't handle it (Fortnite's audience). Campy, fun-scary, not trauma-scary.

## Why It'll Go Viral

### TikTok Clip Factories
- Mimic jump scares → instant viral clips
- "We spent ALL our money on rides and had NO weapons for Night 5" disaster runs
- The Conductor possessing a roller coaster mid-ride
- Clutch dawn survivals at 1 HP
- Finding hidden lore rooms
- Speed-run attempts (5-star in one run?)

### The Social Hook
- "Play DEAD PROFIT with your squad" — co-op inherently drives group content
- Arguments about strategy are entertaining ("WHY DID YOU BUY ANOTHER FERRIS WHEEL")
- Easy to understand from a 15-second clip

### The Name
- **DEAD PROFIT** is memorable, searchable, and tells you exactly what it is
- Works as a hashtag: #DeadProfit #DeadProfitFortnite
