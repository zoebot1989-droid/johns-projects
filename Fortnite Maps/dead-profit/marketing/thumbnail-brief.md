# DEAD PROFIT — Thumbnail Creative Brief

---

## General Guidelines (What Works for Fortnite Thumbnails)

Based on top-performing Fortnite Creative maps:

- **Bold, readable text** — Title should be legible at phone-screen size (Discovery tiles are SMALL)
- **High contrast** — Dark backgrounds with bright focal points perform best for horror
- **Character presence** — A Fortnite skin reacting or in danger adds relatability
- **Visual tension** — Show conflict, danger, or a "what happens next?" moment
- **Color pops** — Neon greens, purples, and reds against dark backgrounds catch eyes in the feed
- **Avoid clutter** — One clear focal point beats a busy scene every time
- **Genre signaling** — Viewers should INSTANTLY know it's horror + tycoon from the thumbnail alone

## Concept A: "The Split" (Recommended)

**Composition:** Vertical split down the middle. Left side is bright, colorful daytime amusement park (ferris wheel, lights, fun). Right side is the same park at night — dark, corrupted, entities lurking, red/purple lighting.

**Color Palette:** Left = warm oranges, yellows, carnival lights. Right = deep purples, blacks, glowing red eyes, sickly green fog.

**Text Overlay:** "DEAD PROFIT" in large distressed carnival/circus font across the center. Subtitle: "BUILD BY DAY. SURVIVE BY NIGHT." smaller beneath.

**Mood:** The contrast IS the hook. Viewers immediately understand the day/night mechanic.

**Key Elements:**
- Ferris wheel visible on both sides (cheerful vs. broken/corrupted)
- Fortnite skin character standing at the divide, looking toward the dark side
- Money/coins falling on the left, entity silhouettes on the right
- Subtle crack/tear effect where the two halves meet

---

## Concept B: "Night Has Fallen"

**Composition:** Full dark scene. A corrupted amusement park at night. A single Fortnite character in the foreground holding a flashlight, illuminating a terrifying entity emerging from a carnival ride.

**Color Palette:** Near-black background, flashlight cone in warm yellow, entity eyes in glowing red/green, neon park signs flickering in the background.

**Text Overlay:** "DEAD PROFIT" in glowing neon sign style (like a broken park entrance sign, some letters flickering). No subtitle needed — the image tells the story.

**Mood:** Pure horror. This version leans into the scary side to attract the horror audience.

**Key Elements:**
- Flashlight beam as primary light source
- Entity partially visible (silhouette > full reveal for horror)
- Broken/tilted carnival rides in background
- Dollar bills scattered on the ground near the entity

## Concept C: "Greed Kills"

**Composition:** Close-up of a Fortnite character's hands overflowing with gold coins and cash, but behind them (slightly blurred) an entity looms in the darkness of a carnival tent.

**Color Palette:** Gold/warm foreground (money), cold purple/black background (entity), red accent lighting.

**Text Overlay:** "DEAD PROFIT" in bold metallic gold font with cracks/damage texture. Optional: "💀" emoji or skull integrated into the dollar sign.

**Mood:** Greed-focused. Communicates the risk/reward core mechanic. The money draws you in, the entity behind makes you uneasy.

**Key Elements:**
- Money as the foreground focal point
- Entity as the background threat (out of focus but visible)
- Character oblivious to danger (looking at money, not behind them)
- Carnival/park environment framing the scene

## Text Styling Notes

- **Font style:** Distressed, carnival/circus-inspired, or broken neon
- **"DEAD" treatment:** Could be in red or have a horror treatment (dripping, cracked)
- **"PROFIT" treatment:** Gold, metallic, or neon green ($$ vibes)
- **Avoid:** Generic horror fonts, too-small text, white text on light backgrounds
- **Must be readable at:** 200x200px (Discovery tile size on mobile)

---

## Deliverables Needed

- **Primary thumbnail:** 1920x1080 (Fortnite Discovery standard)
- **Square crop version:** 1080x1080 (social media)
- **Consider:** How it looks at thumbnail size (zoom out and squint-test it)

## Reference Inspiration

Look at thumbnails from these top Fortnite Creative maps for style reference:
- The Pit (horror maps — dark atmosphere, character reactions)
- Tycoon maps (bright, colorful, showing progression)
- Combine both aesthetics for DEAD PROFIT's unique position
