Rebuild a haunted amusement park by day, survive terrifying entities by night — co-op horror tycoon!

## Medium (Paragraph)
Welcome to DEAD PROFIT, a co-op horror tycoon where you and your squad rebuild a cursed amusement park from the ground up. By day, repair rides, unlock attractions, and rake in cash from ghostly visitors. By night, the park turns against you — entities crawl from the shadows and only teamwork keeps you alive. The more you build, the more they hunger. How long can you keep the lights on?

## Full Description
**DEAD PROFIT** is a co-op horror tycoon experience unlike anything in Fortnite Creative.

You and up to 3 friends inherit a crumbling amusement park built on cursed ground. During the day phase, work together to repair broken rides, construct new attractions, hire spectral staff, and earn profit from the park's eerie visitors. Invest your earnings wisely — every upgrade matters.

But when the sun sets, the park transforms. Entities emerge from the dark corners of every attraction you've built. The bigger your park, the more dangerous the night becomes. Stick together, use your environment, and survive until dawn. Dead players lose their earnings. Profit is everything — but so is staying alive.

**Key Features:**
- 🎪 Build & manage a haunted amusement park
- 👻 Survive increasingly dangerous night phases
- 💰 Earn, invest, and risk your profits
- 🤝 Co-op teamwork (1-4 players)
- 🔓 Unlock 15+ unique attractions
- 📈 Difficulty scales with your success
- 🏆 Leaderboards & high score tracking

*From the creators at Loopgate — build big, profit hard, don't die.*
