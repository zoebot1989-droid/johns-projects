## Server Rules

1. **Be respectful.** No harassment, slurs, hate speech, or personal attacks. Period.
2. **No spam or self-promo.** Share your content in `#content-creators` only. No DM advertising.
3. **Keep channels on topic.** Memes in `#memes`, bugs in `#bug-reports`, etc.
4. **No cheating/exploits.** Report exploits in `#bug-reports`, don't share them publicly.
5. **No NSFW content.** This is an all-ages community.
6. **English only in main channels.** (Or add language-specific channels as community grows)
7. **Listen to staff.** Mod decisions are final. Appeal via DM if needed.
8. **Have fun.** That's literally why we're all here. 🎪

*Breaking rules = warn → mute → kick → ban. Zero tolerance for rule 1 violations.*

## Growth Strategy

### Launch Phase (Week 1-2)
1. **Announce in all socials** — Link Discord in every TikTok bio, tweet, and YouTube description
2. **Influencer invites** — Include Discord link in the influencer kit
3. **Launch event** — Host a "Grand Opening Night" where the team plays live with community members
4. **OG role** — Early joiners get exclusive role (creates urgency)

### Growth Phase (Month 1-3)
1. **Weekly events** — "Longest Night" survival challenges, speedrun competitions, building contests
2. **Leaderboard system** — Track and display top scores in a pinned message or bot
3. **Content creator program** — Invite small/mid creators, give them the CC role, feature their content
4. **Cross-promotion** — Partner with other Fortnite Creative map Discord servers
5. **Clip of the Week** — Feature the best community clip in `#announcements` every week

### Sustained Growth
1. **Consistent updates** — Every patch note drives engagement; post in Discord first
2. **Community input** — Poll members on features, let them vote on next attractions
3. **Seasonal events** — Halloween special, Friday the 13th events, holiday themes
4. **Reward loyalty** — Achievement roles, shoutouts, exclusive sneak peeks for active members
5. **User-generated content** — Fan art contests, lore writing contests, meme competitions

### Tips
- Pin the map code EVERYWHERE (server banner, welcome message, channel topics)
- Keep the energy up in the first 2 weeks — be active, respond to everyone, host events
- Let the community shape itself — if people want a lore channel, make one
- Don't over-moderate early — let personality develop, then refine
