## Map Summary

**DEAD PROFIT** is a co-op horror tycoon built in Fortnite Creative where 1–4 players inherit a decrepit amusement park on cursed ground. During the day, your squad repairs rides, builds new attractions, and earns profit from the park's ghostly clientele. The more you invest, the bigger and more profitable your park becomes — but every upgrade comes with a price.

When night falls, the park transforms into a hunting ground. Entities emerge from the attractions you've built, and the more successful your park, the more dangerous the night becomes. Dead players lose their earnings. The core loop is deceptively simple — build, profit, survive — but the tension between greed and survival creates moments that are genuinely terrifying, hilarious, and endlessly replayable. It's the horror tycoon Fortnite Creative has been missing.
