# Brand Identity — Fortnite Creative Map Builder

## 5 Brand Name Options

### 1. **VOXRIFT**
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Unique, memorable, sounds techy/gaming | Not immediately obvious what you do |
| Available across most platforms | Slightly abstract |
| "Vox" (voice) + "Rift" (Fortnite lore tie-in) | |
| Great logo potential (geometric V + portal) | |

### 2. **GLITCHWERK**
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Instantly reads as gaming/creative | "Glitch" could imply buggy |
| Edgy, memorable, rolls off the tongue | Slightly longer |
| "Werk" implies craftsmanship | Similar names exist in other spaces |
| Perfect for horror/experimental maps | |

### 3. **NØVA LABS**
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Clean, professional, scalable brand | "Nova" is common |
| "Labs" implies experimentation & innovation | Special character (ø) can be annoying for search |
| Works if you expand beyond Fortnite | |
| Approachable yet techy | |

### 4. **HEXACORE**
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Strong, punchy, sounds powerful | Slightly corporate |
| "Hexa" (six-sided, geometric) is visually strong | Less playful |
| Easy to spell and remember | |
| Great abbreviated form: HXC | |

### 5. **LOOPGATE** ⭐ *Recommended*
| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| "Loop" = Fortnite's lore (The Loop) + gameplay loops | Needs strong visual identity to stand out |
| "Gate" = portal, entry point, gatekeeper | |
| Implies you're the gateway to incredible experiences | |
| Short, punchy, easy to say/spell/remember | |
| Works as a verb: "You just got Loopgated" | |
| Natural hashtag: #Loopgate #LoopgateMaps | |

## Recommended Brand Colors

| Color | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| **Electric Violet** | `#7B2FFF` | Primary — headers, logo, accents |
| **Void Black** | `#0D0D0D` | Backgrounds, text |
| **Ghost White** | `#F0F0F5` | Text on dark, clean space |
| **Toxic Green** | `#39FF14` | Highlights, CTAs, "live" indicators |
| **Blood Orange** | `#FF4500` | Alerts, horror-themed content accent |

**Palette Rationale:** Purple is Fortnite-adjacent without copying Epic's blue. The green/orange accents pop on TikTok thumbnails and work for both horror and tycoon content themes.

## Logo Style Direction

- **Primary Mark:** Geometric lettermark — stylized "LG" monogram inside a hexagonal portal shape
- **Style:** Clean lines, slight glitch/distortion effect on one edge
- **Icon Version:** The portal shape alone (works as profile pic at small sizes)
- **Animation:** For intros/TikTok watermark — the portal "opens" with a glitch effect, letters materialize
- **Font Pairing:** Bold geometric sans-serif (like Bebas Neue or Rajdhani) for headers, clean sans (Inter) for body
